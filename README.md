# NTU-Gym-Line-Bot-Integration

> Public Code for Non-Official NTU Gym Real-time Monitor Line Bot

It is not surprising that people go to the gym and are rejected due to the capacity contraint. To deal with this problem, we develop a line bot that can tell users the real-time information about the gym. With current capacity, they can decide the exercising time without going to the gym in vain. This project is developed using Django and wrapped by docker-compose. We also use ngrox to get an instantly https address for Line API.

ü§ñ The project is temporarily stopped developing due to the Covid-19 (the gym is closed now). We will re-start the project once the gym is on.
